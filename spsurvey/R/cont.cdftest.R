# Function: cont.cdftest
# Purpose: Cumulative Distribution Function Inference for Probability Survey Data
# Programmer: Tom Kincaid
# Date: November 15, 2007
# Last Revised: September 23, 2014
# Description:
#   This function organizes input and output for conducting inference regarding
#   cumulative distribution functions (CDFs) generated by a probability survey.
#   Input can be either an object of class spsurvey.analysis (see the
#   documentation for function spsurvey.analysis) or through use of the other
#   arguments to this function.  For every response variable and every
#   population Type, differences between CDFs are tested for every pair of
#   subpopulations within a Type.  The inferential procedures divide the CDFs
#   into a discrete set of intervals (classes) and then utilize procedures that
#   have been developed for analysis of categorical data from probability
#   surveys.  Choices for inference are the Wald, Rao-Scott first order
#   corrected (mean eigenvalue corrected), and Rao-Scott second order corrected
#   (Satterthwaite corrected) test statistics. Both standard versions of the
#   three statistics, which are distributed as Chi-squared random variables, and
#   alternate version of the statistics, which are distributed as F random
#   variables, are available.  The default test statistic is the F distribution
#   version of the Wald statistic.
# Arguments:
#   sites = a data frame consisting of two variables: the first variable is site
#     IDs, and the second variable is a logical vector indicating which sites to
#     use in the analysis.  If spsurvey.obj is not provided, then this argument
#     is required.  The default is NULL.
#   subpop = a data frame describing sets of populations and subpopulations for
#     which estimates will be calculated.  The first variable is site IDs.  Each
#     subsequent variable identifies a Type of population, where the variable
#     name is used to identify Type.  A Type variable identifies each site with
#     one of the subpopulations of that Type.  If spsurvey.obj is not provided,
#     then this argument is required.  The default is NULL.
#   design = a data frame consisting of design variables.  If spsurvey.obj is not
#     provided, then this argument is required.  The default is NULL.  Variables
#     should be named as follows:
#       siteID = site IDs
#       wgt = final adjusted weights, which are either the weights for a
#         single-stage sample or the stage two weights for a two-stage sample
#       xcoord = x-coordinates for location, which are either the x-coordinates
#         for a single-stage sample or the stage two x-coordinates for a two-
#         stage sample
#       ycoord = y-coordinates for location, which are either the y-coordinates
#         for a single-stage sample or the stage two y-coordinates for a two-
#         stage sample
#       stratum = the stratum codes
#       cluster = the stage one sampling unit (primary sampling unit or cluster)
#         codes
#       wgt1 = final adjusted stage one weights
#       xcoord1 = the stage one x-coordinates for location
#       ycoord1 = the stage one y-coordinates for location
#       support = support values - the value one (1) for a site from a finite
#         resource or the measure of the sampling unit associated with a site
#         from an extensive resource, which is required for calculation of
#         finite and continuous population correction factors.
#       swgt = size-weights, which is the stage two size-weight for a two-stage
#         sample.
#       swgt1 = stage one size-weights.
#   data.cont = a data frame of continuous response variables.  The first 
#     variable is site IDs.  Subsequent variables are response variables.
#     Missing data (NA) is allowed.  If spsurvey.obj is not provided, then
#     this argument is required.  The default is NULL.
#   popsize = known size of the resource, which is used to perform ratio
#     adjustment to estimators expressed using measurement units for the
#     resource.  For a finite resource, this argument is either the total number
#     of sampling units or the known sum of size-weights.  For an extensive
#     resource, this argument is the measure of the resource, i.e., either known
#     total length for a linear resource or known total area for an areal
#     resource.  The argument must be in the form of a list containing an
#     element for each population Type in the subpop data frame, where NULL is a
#     valid choice for a population Type.  The list must be named using the
#     column names for the population Types in subpop. If a population Type
#     doesn't contain subpopulations, then each element of the list is either a
#     single value for an unstratified sample or a vector containing a value for
#     each stratum for a stratified sample, where elements of the vector are
#     named using the stratum codes.  If a population Type contains
#     subpopulations, then each element of the list is a list containing an
#     element for each subpopulation, where the list is named using the
#     subpopulation names.  The element for each subpopulation will be either a
#     single value for an unstratified sample or a named vector of values for a
#     stratified sample.  The default is NULL.
#     Example popsize for a stratified sample:
#       popsize = list("Pop 1"=c("Stratum 1"=750,
#                                "Stratum 2"=500,
#                                "Stratum 3"=250),
#                      "Pop 2"=list("SubPop 1"=c("Stratum 1"=350,
#                                                "Stratum 2"=250,
#                                                "Stratum 3"=150),
#                                   "SubPop 2"=c("Stratum 1"=250,
#                                                "Stratum 2"=150,
#                                                "Stratum 3"=100),
#                                   "SubPop 3"=c("Stratum 1"=150,
#                                                "Stratum 2"=150,
#                                                "Stratum 3"=75)),
#                      "Pop 3"=NULL)
#     Example popsize for an unstratified sample:
#       popsize = list("Pop 1"=1500,
#                      "Pop 2"=list("SubPop 1"=750,
#                                   "SubPop 2"=500,
#                                   "SubPop 3"=375),
#                      "Pop 3"=NULL)
#   popcorrect = a logical value that indicates whether finite or continuous 
#     population correction factors should be employed during variance
#     estimation, where TRUE = use the correction factors and FALSE = do not use
#     the correction factors.  The default is FALSE.
#   pcfsize = size of the resource, which is required for calculation of finite
#     and continuous population correction factors for a single-stage sample.
#     For a stratified sample this argument must be a vector containing a value
#     for each stratum and must have the names attribute set to identify the
#     stratum codes.  The default is NULL.
#   N.cluster = the number of stage one sampling units in the resource, which is
#     required for calculation of finite and continuous population correction
#     factors for a two-stage sample.  For a stratified sample this argument
#     must be a vector containing a value for each stratum and must have the
#     names attribute set to identify the stratum codes.  The default is NULL.
#   stage1size = size of the stage one sampling units of a two-stage sample,
#     which is required for calculation of finite and continuous population
#     correction factors for a two-stage sample and must have the names
#     attribute set to identify the stage one sampling unit codes.  For a
#     stratified sample, the names attribute must be set to identify both
#     stratum codes and stage one sampling unit codes using a convention where
#     the two codes are separated by the & symbol, e.g., "Stratum 1&Cluster 1".
#     The default is NULL.
#   sizeweight = a logical value that indicates whether size-weights should 
#     be used in the analysis, where TRUE = use the size-weights and FALSE = do
#     not use the size-weights.  The default is FALSE.
#   vartype = the choice of variance estimator, where "Local" = local mean
#     estimator and "SRS" = SRS estimator.  The default is "Local".
#   testname = name of the test statistic to be reported in the output data
#     frame.  Choices for the name are: "Wald", "Wald_F", "Mean_Eigenvalue",
#     "Mean_Eigenvalue_F", "Satterthwaite", and "Satterthwaite_F".  The default
#     is "Wald_F".
#   nclass = number of classes into which the CDFs will be divided (binned),
#     which must equal at least three.  The default is 3.
#   spsurvey.obj = A list of class spsurvey.analysis that was produced by the
#     function spsurvey.analysis.  Depending on input to that function, some
#     elements of the list may be NULL.  The default is NULL.
# Results:
#   A data frame of CDF test results for all pairs of subpopulations within each
#   population Type for every response variable.  The data frame includes the
#   test statistic specified by argument testname plus its degrees of freedom
#   and p-value.
# Other Functions Required:
#   dframe.check - check site IDs, the sites data frame, the subpop data frame,
#     and the data.rr data frame to assure valid contents and, as necessary,
#   vecprint - takes an input vector and outputs a character string with line
#     breaks inserted
#   uniqueID - creates unique site IDs by appending a unique number to each
#     occurrence of a site ID
#   input.check - check input values for errors, consistency, and compatibility
#     with spsurvey.analysis analytical functions
#   cdf.test - test for differences between cumulative distribution functions
#     (CDFs)
