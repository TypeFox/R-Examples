#' downloader: a package for making it easier to download files over https
#' 
#' This package provides a wrapper for the download.file function,
#' making it possible to download files over https on Windows, Mac OS X, and
#' other Unix-like platforms. The RCurl package provides this functionality
#' (and much more) but can be difficult to install because it must be compiled
#' with external dependencies. This package has no external dependencies, so
#' it is much easier to install.
