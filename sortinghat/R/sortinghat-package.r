#' sortinghat
#'
#' sortinghat is a classification framework to streamline the evaluation of
#' classifiers (classification models and algorithms) and seeks to determine the
#' best classifiers on a variety of simulated and benchmark data sets. Several
#' error-rate estimators are included to evaluate the performance of a
#' classifier. This package is intended to complement the well-known 'caret'
#' package.
