#' Minimum Hellinger Distance Test for Normality
#
#' @description
#'   This function fits a normal distribution to a data set using a mimimum Hellinger distance approach and
#'   then performs a test of hypothesis that the data are from a normal distribution.
#
#' @details
#'   Let \emph{f(x)} and \emph{g(x)} be absolutely continuous probability density functions.  The square of the
#'   Hellinger distance can be written as \eqn{H^2 = 1 - \int\sqrt{f(x)g(x)}dx}.  For this package, \emph{f(x)}
#'   denotes the family of normal densities and \emph{g} is a data-based density obtained by using the Ephanechnikov
#'   kernel. The kernel has the form \eqn{w(z)=0.75(1-z^2 )} for \samp{-1<z<1} and 0 elsewhere.  Let the
#'   \emph{n} sample data be denoted by \eqn{x_1}{X1}, ..., \eqn{x_n}{Xn}.  The data-based kernel density at any
#'   point \emph{y} is calculated from \deqn{g_n(y) = \frac{1}{n s_n c_n }\sum\limits_{i=1}^n w(\frac{y-x_i}{s_n c_n})}
#'
#'   A Newton-Rhapson method with analytical derivatives is to determine the minimum Hellinger distance.
#'   Numerical integration is done using a 6-point composite Gauss-Legendre technique.
#
# Parameters:
#' @param   DataVec       The data are supplied by the user in a numeric vector.  The length of the vector determines the number of data values.
#
#' @param   NGauss        The number of subintervals for the Gauss-Legendre integration techniques is controlled by \code{NGauss}.  A default value of 100 is used.  A minimum of 25 is enforced.
#
#' @param   MaxIter       The maximum number of iterations that can occur in evaluating the minimum Hellinger distance is controlled by \code{MaxIter}.  A default of 25 is used.  A minimum of 1 is enforced.
#
#' @param   InitLocation  An optional initial location estimate can be defined using \code{InitLocation}.  The data median is the default value.
#
#' @param   InitScale     An optional initial scale estimate can be defined using \code{InitScale}. The data median absolute deviation is the default value.
#
#' @param   EpsLoc        The epsilon (in data units) below which the iterative minimization approach declares convergence in the location estimate is controlled by \code{EpsLoc}.  \code{EpsLoc} should be set to give approximately 5 digits of accuracy in the location estimate. A default value of 0.0001 is used.
#
#' @param   EpsSca        The epsilon (in data units) below which the iterative minimization approach declares convergence in the SCALE estimate is controlled by \code{EpsSca}.  \code{EpsSca} should be set to give approximately 5 digits of accuracy in the scale estimate. A default value of 0.0001 is used.
#
#' @param   Silent        A value of FALSE for \code{Silent} writes several results to the R console.  Use \code{Silent}=TRUE to eliminate the output.
#
#' @param   Small         A value of FALSE for \code{Small} returns a list of 11 objects.  Use \code{Small}=TRUE to return a shorter list containing only the Hellinger distance and the p-value.
#
# Returned values:
#' @return   Values returned in a list include the following items:
#' \itemize{
#'     \item {Minimized Hellinger distance}
#'     \item {p-value for the minimized distance}
#'     \item {Initial location used in the iterative solution}
#'     \item {Initial scale used in the iterative solution}
#'     \item {Final location estimate}
#'     \item {Final scale estimate}
#'     \item {Sample size}
#'     \item {Kernel density bandwidth parameter}
#'     \item {Vector of x values used in the integration for the Hellinger distance}
#'     \item {Vector of nonparametric density values at the x values used in the integration}
#'     \item {Vector of normal density values for the estimated location and scale at the x values used in integration}
