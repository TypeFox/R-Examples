#'
#' Lights Out is a puzzle game consisting of a grid of lights
#' that are either on or off. Pressing any light will toggle it and its
#' adjacent lights. The goal of the game is to switch all the lights off. This
#' package provides an interface to play the game on different board sizes,
#' both through the command line or with a visual application. Puzzles can
#' also be solved using the automatic solver included.
