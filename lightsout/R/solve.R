#' Solve a Lights Out board
#'
#' Given a Lights Out board, find the set of lights that need to be pressed in
#' order to solve the board. If no solution is possible, an error is thrown.
#'
#' There are a few algorithms for solving Lights Out puzzles. This function
#' implements the Gaussian Elimination technique, which does not guarantee
#' the minimum number of steps. Therefore, some steps in the given solution
#' may be redundant.
#'
#' If you are interested, there are many resources online outlining the exact
#' details of how this technique works, and what the other solving strategies are.
#'
#' @param board A \code{lightsout} board object.
#' @return A matrix with the same dimensions as the input board, with a \code{1}
#' in every position that requires a press to solve to the board. Note that the
#' order of the light presses does not matter.

#' @examples
#' # Create an empty 5x5 board, press two lights, and then see that the solution
#' # tells us to press the same lights in order to solve the board.
