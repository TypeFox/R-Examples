#' @title Catch and effort data for Fantail Darter.
#' 
#' @description Catch and effort data for Fantail Darter (\emph{Etheostoma flabellare}) from seven removal events conducted by Mahon (1980).
#' 
#' @details Catch (number of fish) was recorded.  Effort was a constant amount of electrofishing for each sampling event and is, thus, entered as a constant value of 1.
#' 
#' These data are used in many publications because the stream section was rotenoned following the removal surveys to determine a known population size of 1151 individuals.
