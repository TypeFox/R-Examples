#' regexr: Tools for Human Readable Regular Expressions
#'
#' \pkg{regexr} is an R framework for constructing and managing human readable 
#' regular expressions.  It aims to provide tools that enable the user to write 
#' regular expressions in a way that is similar to the ways R code is written.  
#' The tools allow the user to:
#' \enumerate{
#'   \item Write in smaller, modular, named, \emph{sub-expressions}
#'   \item Write top to bottom, rather than a single string
#'   \item Comment individual \emph{sub-expressions}
#'   \item Indent expressions to represent regular expression groups
#'   \item Add vertical line spaces and R comments (i.e., \code{#})
#'   \item Test the validity of the \emph{concatenated expression} and the modular sub-expressions
#' } 
#' This framework harnesses the power and flexibility of regular expressions 
#' but provides a structural frame that is more consistent with both code 
#' writing and natural language conventions.
