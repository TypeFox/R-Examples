#' A dataset containing distances acorns of two oak species were carried by
#' acorn woodpeckers (\emph{Melanerpes formicivorus}) to their granaries, in
#' two different years for each oak species.  Data were collected in oak
#' savanna habitat in central California.  Acorn woodpeckers store acorns in
#' central granaries, and different woodpecker social groups maintain
#' different granaries. The variables are as follows:
#' \itemize{
#'     \item Species, the species of oak for the observed acorn ("lobata" for
#'         \emph{Quercus lobata}, "agrifolia" for \emph{Quercus agrifolia})
#'     \item Year, the year of observation (2002 and 2004 for
#'         \emph{Quercus lobata}, 2006 and 2007 for \emph{Quercus agrifolia})
#'     \item Granary, the woodpecker granary from which the acorn was collected
#'     \item Distance, distance in metres from the acorn source tree to the
#'         granary
#' }
