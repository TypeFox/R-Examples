#' Methods for causal inference with interference
#' 
#' Interference occurs when the treatment of one unit affects outcomes of other
#' units. This package provides methods for estimating causal effects in the 
#' presence of interference. Currently it implements the IPW estimators 
#' proposed by \href{http://dx.doi.org/10.1177/0962280210386779}{Tchetgen Tchetgen and Vanderweele (2012)}.
#' and developed further in \href{http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/biom.12184}{Heydrich-Perez et al. (2014)}.
