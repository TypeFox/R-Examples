#' Compute most probable path with extended Viterbi algorithm.
#' 
#' Viterbi algorithm for Hidden Markov Model with duration
#' @param aa_sample \code{character} vector representing single aminoacid sequence.
#' @param pipar probabilities of initial state in Markov Model.
#' @param tpmpar matrix of transition probabilities between states.
#' @param od matrix of response probabilities. Eg. od[1,2] is a probability of signal 2 in state 1.
#' @param params matrix of probability distribution for duration. Eg. params[10,2] is probability of duration of time 10 in state 2.
#' @export
#' @return A list of length four:
#' \itemize{
#'  \item{path}{ a vector of most probable path}
#'  \item{viterbi}{ values of probability in all intermediate points,}
#'  \item{psi}{ matrix that gives for every signal and state the previous state in viterbi path,}
#'  \item{duration}{ matrix that gives for every signal and state gives the duration in that state on viterbi path.}
#'  }
#' @note All computations are on logarithms of probabilities.
