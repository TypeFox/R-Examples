#' @description An R implementation of SRCS: Statistical Ranking Color Scheme for visualizing the results of multiple pairwise comparisons in many
#'	problem configurations at the same time, each defined by at most 3 additional parameters. For each problem configuration,
#'	this technique ranks every level of the target value according to the performance in relation to how other levels 
#'	perform on the same problem configuration. Ranks are assigned according to statistical performance comparisons. Then,
#'	a color is associated to each rank so it can be easily visualized and interpreted.
