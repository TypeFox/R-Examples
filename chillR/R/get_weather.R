#' Download weather data from online database
#' 
#' This function retrieves either a list of nearby weather stations for a
#' specified point location, or it downloads weather data for a specific
#' weather station.
#' 
#' weather databases, from which chillR can download data: NOAA NCDC Global
#' Summary of the Day - "GSOD"
#' (https://data.noaa.gov/dataset/global-surface-summary-of-the-day-gsod)
#' 
#' Weather Underground ("Wunderground") airport database - "Wunderground"
#' (http://www.wunderground.com/)
#' 
#' California Irrigation Management Information System (CIMIS) - "CIMIS"
#' (http://www.cimis.water.ca.gov/)
#' 
#' University of California Integrated Pest Management (UCIPM) - "UCIPM"

#' several formats are possible for specifying the location vector, which can
#' consist of either two or three coordinates (it can include elevation).
#' Possible formats include c(1,2,3), c(1,2), c(x=1,y=2,z=3),
#' c(lat=2,long=1,elev=3). If elements of the vector are not names, they are
#' interpreted as c(Longitude, Latitude, Elevation).
#' 
#' The 'chillRCode' is generated by this function, when it is run with
#' geographic coordinates as location inputs. In the list of nearby stations
#' that is returned then, the chillRCode is provided and can then be used as
#' input for running the function in 'downloading' mode. For downloading the
#' data, use the same call as before but replace the location argument with the
#' chillRCode.
#' 
#' @param location either a vector of geographic coordinates, or the
#' 'chillRcode' of a weather station in the specified database. See details.
#' @param time_interval numeric vector with two elements, specifying the start
#' and end date of the period of interest.
#' @param database the database to be accessed. Must be "GSOD", "CIMIS",
#' "Wunderground" or "UCIPM". Since among these, "UCIPM" is the most
#' comprehensive one for California, the initial area of interest, this is the
#' default.
#' @param station_list if the list of weather stations has already been
#' downloaded, the list can be passed to the function through this argument.
#' This can save a bit of time, since it can take a bit of time to download the
#' list, which can have several MB.
#' @param stations_to_choose_from if the location is specified by geographic
#' coordinates, this argument determines the number of nearby stations in the
#' list that is returned.
#' @param end_at_present boolean variable indicating whether the interval of
#' interest should end on the present day, rather than extending until the end
#' of the year specified under time_interval[2] (if time_interval[2] is the
#' current year).
#' @return The output depends on how the location is provided. If it is a
#' coordinate vector, the function returns a list of station_to_choose_from
#' weather stations that are close to the specified location. This list also
#' contains information about how far away these stations are (in km), how much
#' the elevation difference is (if elevation is specified; in m) and how much
#' overlap there is between the data contained in the database and the time
#' period specified by time_interval.
#' @note Many databases have data quality flags, which may sometimes indicate
#' that data aren't reliable. These are not considered by this function!

#' see the documentation of the handler functions (e.g. handle_wunderground,
#' handle_ucipm) for details.
