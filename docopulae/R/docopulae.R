#' Design of Experiments with Copulas
#'
#' A direct approach to optimal designs for copula models based on the Fisher information.
#' Provides flexible functions for building joint PDFs, evaluating the Fisher information and finding optimal designs.
#' It includes an extensible solution to summation and integration called `nint`, functions for transforming, plotting and comparing designs, as well as a set of tools for common low-level tasks.
