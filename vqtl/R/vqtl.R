#'  The \pkg{vqtl} package allows users to conduct genome scans with a double generalized linear model
#'  on a cross object from the popular \pkg{qtl} package.
#'  This model can accomodate and target genetic and non-genetic effects on trait variance and
#'  allows the user to test for loci that influence trait mean, variance, or "either".
